Do keyframes have consistent order?
Do sequences have consistent order?
Do sequences overlap?
Are there unused components?
Are there adjacent repeating keyframes' data or times?
Are there unused keyframes?
Or any components' values in their allowed range?
Are there duplicating geosets?
Are there duplicating geoset animations?
Is the number of extents equal to the number of sequences?
Is the number of geoset animations equal to th enumber of geosets?
Are there geosets with more than 255 matrix groups?
Are there sequences with invalid interval? (zero,negative)
Are there invisible geosets (by geoset animation) or nodes (by visibility) ?
Are any nodes using 0 scaling instead of visibility?
Are some geosets having matrix groups containin non-bone nodes?
Is interpolation for visibilities none?
Are there bones to which tehre are no attached vertices?
Are there event objects without tracks?
Are there geoset animations not using geosets?
Are there missing starting/ending tracks in animated components?
Are there isolated vertices?
Are there isolated triangles?
Are there overlapping vertices?
Are there overlapping triangles?
Are there repeating matrix groups?
Are there animated components with no keyframes?
Are thre invalid node relationships? (non-existing, self-refrerencing, mutual referencing)
